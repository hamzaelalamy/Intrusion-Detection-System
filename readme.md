**Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning and Neural Networks** <br>

**Overview**<br>
This project is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) developed as an end-of-studies project. The IDS utilizes machine learning techniques, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. Additionally, a neural network model has been implemented for intrusion detection.

The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive environment for data analysis, model development, and evaluation.

**Features**
Utilizes multiple machine learning models for intrusion detection.
Implements a neural network model for enhanced detection accuracy.
Interactive Jupyter Notebook environment for experimentation and analysis.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
TensorFlow (for neural network)

**Usage**
Open the Intrusion_Detection_System.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the provided instructions to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
Experiment with different configurations, parameters, and algorithms to improve the detection accuracy.

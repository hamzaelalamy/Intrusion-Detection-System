**Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning and Neural Networks** <br>

**Overview**<br>
This project is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) developed as an end-of-studies project. The IDS utilizes machine learning techniques, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. Additionally, a neural network model has been implemented for intrusion detection.<br>

The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive environment for data analysis, model development, and evaluation.<br>

**Features**<br>
Utilizes multiple machine learning models for intrusion detection.<br>
Implements a neural network model for enhanced detection accuracy.<br>
Interactive Jupyter Notebook environment for experimentation and analysis.<br>

**Requirements**<br>
Python 3.x<br>
Jupyter Notebook<br>
NumPy<br>
pandas<br>
scikit-learn<br>
TensorFlow (for neural network)<br>

**Usage**<br>
Open the Intrusion_Detection_System.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook.<br>
Follow the provided instructions to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.<br>
Experiment with different configurations, parameters, and algorithms to improve the detection accuracy.<br>
